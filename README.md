# ðŸŽ„ nakatomi ðŸŽ„

## Why?

**Fact:** Everyone wants to watch Die Hard every year at christmas time.

**Problem:** No one has time to check the tv-guide all the time, to see when and where it's on.

**Solution:** Use `nakatomi` to check the tv-guide, while you can spend your precious time doing important stuff (like automating stupid things).

## How?

1. Create a `config.json` file in root (hint: `config.example.json`)
2. Run `go run cmd/nakatomi/main.go`
